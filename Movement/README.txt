General:
	-Everything necessary for each part of the assignment should be contained in their respective folders.
	
	-If a file is missing for some reason, the TimeLine.java, RealTimeLine.java and BreadCrumb.java files don't change between parts.
	
	-TimeLine.java is an interface that RealTimeLine.java makes use of.
	
	-RealTimeLine.java is a time line that is anchored to real time. It is used to track how much time has passed.
	
	-BreadCrumb.java represent one of the bread crumbs that gets left behind as the character traverses the screen.
	
	-SteeringUnit.java represents a character that is meant to travel around the screen and the steering behaviors it uses.
	
	-I recommend using eclipse due to the processing-eclipse interactions, look at the main method in the files that get run for the package names I used.
		-each part gets its own package
